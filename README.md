Access your Calendar

## About

With this skill, you can access your iCal server, or just use a [local calendar on your device](https://bit.ly/mycroft-calendar-ics), that doesn't sync anywhere. This skill needs configuration if you use an iCal server.

## Examples

- "What's on my calendar?"
- "Add a event"
- "How many events do I have?"
- "What's on my Almanac?"
- "Add a event call Bob's birthday."
